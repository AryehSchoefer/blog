Aaaahhh, another blog, or rather, developer blog? I’m not sure yet. Let’s say developer blog for now, as I don’t know what else to currently frequently write about. If this is even going to be frequent is a question for itself. All I know is that I felt like developing something simple where I can write down my thoughts.

I want to preface this by saying that, I am a terrible writer. Back in school, I always had the shortest, most concise essays possible. I remember struggling to write an essay exam in third grade because one of the requirements was to write a minimum of 100 words. While everyone else easily crushed that requirement, I argued with the teacher about me being incapable of hitting it, as I already had all the information asked for in the exercise written in my essay. Mind you, this was in German, which is my mother tongue, so English won’t be better. Having said that, I won’t be using an LLM to generate any text on principle. I need to improve somehow, and practice makes perfect.

## My Brain

If I had to explain why I am starting a developer blog in 2026, it would come down to some simple points I thought about.

As a software engineer with an inherent passion for learning and challenging myself, I constantly get intrigued by new topics in software engineering. Catching myself starting three technical books at the same time, kicking off a new side project with a new framework that’s going viral on Twitter, all while also trying to learn Zig. Considering I am still an employed software engineer, and if I were to compare my knowledge from a year ago with now, there seems to be something about my curiosity that does work. Somehow, I am progressing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main issue is that I have no way to visualize my progress. I could start pushing my learning projects to GitHub to track it to some extent, but even then, looking back months or years later won’t magically help me remember the reasoning behind every implementation decision I made. Being able to reflect on how I approach problems and how I approached them in the past is very valuable to me.

If only there were a widely adopted way for developers to track their progress, share insights, and reflect publicly…

Writing things down forces me to slow down, which is a much-needed change. It forces me to make my thoughts explicit instead of letting them live as vague ideas in my head. When I try to explain why I implemented something the way I did or why I approached something the way I did, I often realize that I either understand it much better than I thought or that I don’t understand it at all. Both outcomes are useful, although I actually hope more for the latter. Does that make sense?

Blogging also adds a layer of accountability. Even if nobody reads this, the idea that someone could makes me think twice about decisions. Would this make sense to someone else? Would past me agree with this reasoning? Would future me cringe? That extra scrutiny is something I would not get in any other way.

Another motivation is reflection. I want a place where I can document things I tried, things that worked, and things that very much did not. Looking at old repositories rarely tells the full story. The reasoning, trade-offs, and wrong turns are usually gone. Or buried under a slew of `this should work??` commits. This blog is my attempt to keep those around and make fun of my past self’s decisions.

So this will be a developer blog, at least for now. It will definitely be messy, occasionally unfocused, and probably not even optimized for what I am hoping to gain from it. I’ll write about things I’m learning, side projects I start (and abandon, of course, can’t forget about those), architectural decisions I’m unsure and too sure about, and lessons I wish I had learned earlier.

If nothing else, this will be a record of how I think today so that one day I can look back and see how much of it has changed.
